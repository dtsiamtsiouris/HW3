## Description of the Project

The project an analysis of the data set from an online survey that 29 students completed from Dr. Johnson's Advanced Data Analysis class. This project aims to collectively analyze parts of the data by finding ways to decide what to do about missing data for birthday day and birthday month and recoded data to account for those missing values to clean up the data set. We also created a variable that gives the season corresponding to the dates in which respondents were born. We then used the add margins function. Finally, in this project, we found the percentages matches for which the respondents favorite month falls within their favorite season. Overall, this project aimed to allow for an opportunity to interact with the data set creatively, clean the data, account for missing data and see how our data looked following our changes.

## Description of the Data set

This assignment presents a data set produced from Dr. Johnson's Advanced Data Analysis Wednesday Class. Students in the class completed an online survey through Google Forms. There were 29 respondents and 27 variables. The data set is entitled "C1Survey". The data set includes qualitative and quantitative responses. The data set represents demographic factors such as country of origin, home state, home city and highest level of education attained. The data set also includes data about student interested including questions about animals, favorite numbers, favorite seasons and month, days of the week, food. Related to data analysis, the data set represents comfort with statistical software and coding and interests in public health. The data is representative of the ADA Wednesday section.

## Description of the Code

The code produced is a R Markdown File titled "Final.LAB1.Rmd." The code uses data from the C1Survey. The code analysis was conducted in R. This file contains seven questions assigned by Dr. Johnson. The code includes importing the data set into R, renaming the variables to be descriptive, determining the type of variable in the data set, checking missing values, cleaning up the data set, finding measures of central tendencies. The code also includes the creations of new variables and use the table function to check codes. Additionally, I conducted an analysis to determine the percentage of participants whose favorite month falls within their favorite season. Then, I broke those measurements down by season -- Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall.
